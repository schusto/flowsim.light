# FlowSim Light

FlowSim Light is a lightweight, browser-based workflow simulator.

## Presets

The **Add Workitem** modal now provides a **Preset** selector. Choosing a preset automatically fills in common values (type, size, complexity and initial state) so you can quickly add typical items like a *Small Bug* or *Large Feature*.

You can still adjust any field after selecting a preset.
